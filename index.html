With her restful body dressed in her nightwear, she woke up to another day. Amy, after last night’s adventure, needed the sleep and with it she wanted more but she knew she had to get out of bed, for it was a busy day ahead. She eventually got up, sat at the side of the bed pushed her feet in her fuzzy yellow bunny bedroom slippers and she noticed the mess the room was in, thought to herself “Was I really that drunk?”, “I am going to have to clean this place up when I get back” she continued to think to herself… She got up, headed towards the bathroom and did her usual morning routine. Amy got dressed in a lovely yellow top and fitted black skirt that rested beneath her knees along with her beige wedges, did her light makeup along with continuing her morning routine and was off to the library where she worked. 
<br><br>
(The day before)
Josh, Mathew, and Jane picked up Amy after work in Mathew’s matte black Ford F-150 truck. It was an unexpected situation for Amy, she had only gotten the call a few minutes before they arrived saying to  be ready and to come outside. Josh, Jane and Mathew planned an outing for Amy because she works a lot, they came up with the idea to take her out for the evening to a few places. All together, they went to a gift shop which theme was ancient and historical items. They thought it would be very fitting for her since she reads a lot of historical books being in a library all day. They arrived and went inside and started borwsing around. There Amy was walking along and a tiki totem caught her eye, she went up to it and picked up, she then examined it and took interest in it so she bought it. The other guys didn’t buy anything other than Josh’s keychain- which he bought as a souvenir- and Jane’s historical cup. 
<br><br>
Next up was the club, after the boring place was out of the picture they started with the real plans: Take Amy out to party. Amy doesn’t like to party, but she made an exception that time. Josh started her off easy with a light drink, she not being a fan of alcohol didn’t know what to drink, he got her a Pina Colada-  a simple fruity alcohol beverage- while everyone else had their own personal favoruites. As time went by, they got tequila shots,  Amy wanting to try took a few and she got pretty drunk pretty quickly. Her friends cheered for her for finally letting loose and having fun, she felt the rush and kept going till she loss cognitive ability and was numb… Amy didn’t remember how she reached home, her friends made sure she got home safely though.

(The present)
Sitting at her desk, she decided to check the library for any persons that were loitering, so she  got  up and started walking amongnst the bookshelves.When she got to the third aisle she noticed that the books were scattered and unorganised along the shleves, she knew something wasn’t right. Every end of the day the library is tidied so seeing that was intriguing to her, but she repacked the shleves and aligned the books as they should’ve been. As she placed the last book in it’s place, she felt a cold draft, a chilled wind, passed her.
“That’s weird, there aren’t any open windows here” she said to herself,
“Where did that wind come from then?” she wondered… Amy just shrugged it off and continued her duties.
<br><br>
It was getting close to lunch time and Amy was gettung hungry, so she went for her food when she noticed it was cold and spoilt so she threw it away. “Strange” she thought, “I only made it this morning, guess i’ll be buying lunch today” She continued. After finishing lunch she resumed work and went home. 
<br><br>
“Damn, I forgot I had this mess to clean up” she spoke in angst. Amy got straight to it and started cleaning up her apartment, whilst cleaning she found the totem from yesterday and placed it on her end table besides her bed where her lamp resided. It was mostly clothes and moved furniture so it wasn’t long before she was finshed tidying. Amy was tired, she went for a nice relaxing hot shower made dinner and went on her bed to eat and browse her phone… Not long after that she started feeling sleepy so she washed up and made herself comftable in bed but she could not fall asleep, she was restless. Amy tried all different postions and even getting up and exercing to make her body more tired; it didn’t help. Soon came sun rise and Amy had no amount of sleep. Today was looking to be a day from how it started. Amy still had work to go to as it’s only the middle of the week today...So she got dressed, made lunch and left for work at the library. 
<br><br>
Amy was nodding away at her desk, but she couldn’t sleep at work so she got up and decided to walk around a bit. It somewhat helped but she had to keep finding ways to distract herself from falling asleep at work. Soon came lunch, she thought food would do the trick and give her energy to the last the rest of the day. She got up quickly to get her food only to find that it was cold and spoilt again. Something was definitely up she thought but she couldn’t waste time thinking, she needed food and out of the library she went into the daylight, that burned her restless eyes, and bought something from the local food vendors. After having ate lunch, she felt a bit energetic like she could hold up for the rest of the day, well at least until work finishes. She made it through work and went straight home, showered had dinner and went to bed as soon as she finished eating...But she could not sleep, hours had passed and it was daytime again and there Amy was, another day without sleep and needed to go to work. She couln’t do anything so she went to work very very tired and she wore a lot of make up to hide her baggy, dark eyes…
